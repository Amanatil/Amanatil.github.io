excerpt: An open-world Fishing Adventure

My work on Call of the Wild: The Angler was quite varried. I worked on everything from gameplay design to tools implementation, with my main focus being on designing complex systems to support our gameplay needs. I also worked closely with data and analytics and was in close contact with our beta testing community. 

My favourite part of working on the Angler - besides the amazing team - was working on the fish spawning system. With the open world maps being so big and often changing while in development we needed a sollution to spawn fish all around the world with minimal developer hand-placement. This turned into the Fish Spawning System that combines tons of data points from the world (Temperature, time of day, altitude, water depth, water spead, etc.) to infer things such as food, shade, and more. Matching this up with the information we have about the different types of fish, we could spawn the fish based on (semi) realistic behavior of where these species could be found in the real world.
