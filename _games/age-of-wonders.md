I did my design internship at Triump Studios in Delft. Here I was responsible for designing and implementing gameplay content for DLC 2 (Invasions) and 3 (Star Kings). On the Invasions DLC I designed, wrote, and implemented World Events. On the Star Kings DLC I was helping the main designer with the design of the Galactic Empire.
