Ever since I was first introduced to D&D in my early teenage years I've been building my own worlds worlds, writing stories, desigining monsters and dungeons - everything for running a homebrew session. 

Over the years I've ran hundreds of sessions with dozens of people in a handful of different settings and worlds. From low-stakes, small dungeons with a hob goblin at the end, to simulation a royal ball with 20+ detailed characters with the faith of entire kingdoms resting on the shoulders of my players. 

## The Embassy Heist
One of my favourite adventures I've ever designed is "The Embassy Heist". Originally designed as a birthday gift to my best friend, this 'dungeon' takes the D&D framework and turns it on its head. 

Premise: 
The players need to sneak their way into the embassy of a not-so-friendly nation, steal a letter from the desk of the head-ambassador, and leave a replica before getting out unnoticed. 

The catch:
This burglary runs in real-time, as opposed to the usual D&D turn-based combat, with a timer and a full schedule of where the embassy's inhabitants are. Being noticed or caught would not be the end, however. This adventure relies heavily on escalating tension, and success is flexible. 

For this adventure I prepared a massive spreadsheet of all the embassy's personal's movements and locations over realtime, a detailed map of a 4 floor mansion, and was keeping a constant timer running during the session. 

I also printed "blueprints" of the building as player reference, printed and cut out all the different rooms so they could be revealed as the players stepped into them, and constantly updated them on noises made by wandering NPCs. 

According to my friends, it was the most intense session they ever played - and it has even been played by one of them with other groups afterwards. 

Assets for this can be found in my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-sO9SWfftdAa_LyVJIlsRTwypifOINmU?usp=drive_link).
