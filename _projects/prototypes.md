Keeping an active mind in making video games outside of professional work is a lot of fun. While it can be difficult to actually get started - or very easy to get lost in the sauce of scope creep - I'm always enjoying making my own silly little projects. Godot especially makes it very easy to just make things. 

Over the last year I've done a game jam game with a friend, created my own "spell crafting" system, writting a bunch of documents for game ideas, recreated snake for practise - and even smaller projects that never really went anywhere.
