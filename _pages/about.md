## Who I Am

I'm Nathanael van den Berg, a Game Designer currently living in Stockholm.Â 

I've been in the industry for over half a decade, and worked on widely different games over the years. From hardcore 4X with Age of Wonders: Planetfall, to semi-simulation fishing game TheAngler, to a mobile lite-RPG for kids.

I love building systems and implementing them. I've done many progression systems, procedural spawning systems, economy, crafting, and more over the years - most of them from scratch. I've done this in all kinds of engines, from proprietary to commercially available such as Unity, Unreal, and Godot. 

I'm most at home when I can collaborate with fellow creative people, bouncing ideas off each other until we have an understanding of the design we want - and then go off to create our designs. Working together with different disciplines and hearing their feedback on designs is a lot of fun to me, and seeing a design come to life is honestly a big part of why I love making games. 

## What I'm looking for

I'm currently looking for jobs based in Stockholm, Sweden or remote, though I'm willing to relocate for the right job.
