excerpt: A lite-RPG for kids on Mobile
---

For Noid Games I worked as a systems, gameplay, and economy designer. This included designing gameplay and progression systems, designer tools, and the game’s economy from the ground up. I’ve also worked to design and set up telemetry and tracking, working together with and co-ordinating the involved teams. The game is a 3D multiplayer mobile adventure game for tweens, and as such required streamlining of complex systems down to a more easy to understand and bite sized interactions. 

Sadly, this project was cancelled and the studio folded as a result of decisions made within Toca Boca's parent company Spinmaster, of which Noid was a part. 

## Economy Design

I had dabbled in small-scale economy design before, but with Noid I was able to dive headfirst into designing the economy for a live lite-RPG game. This meant laying the ground rules for what value means inside the game, coming up with rules and formulas to create consistency in assinging that value to objects, devising ways of measuring time spent vs value earned by players, and simulating different playstyles and behaviors in order to tweak where rewards could be best put to stimulate certain player behaviors. 

All of this was helped by also being the designer responsible for designing progression, from short to medium to long term progression. Having all of these designs in my head meant I was able to marry the different concepts and designs deeply so they all worked in tandem. 

## Responsibilities
  - **Economy Design**
  - **Progression Design**
  - **Telemetry & Analytics** : I worked closely with the data and analytics team at Toca Boca to ensure our tracking worked, and we got the data we were looking for, while also working as an intermediary between them and the rest of the team to communicate needs back and forth. 
  - **Gameplay Design & Prototyping** : I worked together with the rest of the team to design new game modes, activities, items, etc. and prototyped them in Unity. 
  - **Mentoring & Leading feature teams** : I mentored our junior designer, and lead feature teams - alongsides my senior - that worked on implementing my designs.
