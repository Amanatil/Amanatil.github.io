excerpt: Photos taken with various cosplayers across Europe
---

I've been into cosplay ever since I visted my first anime convention in 2009. After taking my first photos with a DSLR I realized that I enjoyed taking photos even more than cosplaying - and so I've been shooting ever since. 

While I shot most photos before I moved to stockholm, I still shoot occasionally.
